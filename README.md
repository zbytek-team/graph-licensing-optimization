# üéì Modeling Optimal Software License Purchasing in Social Networks using Graph Domination

_Master's Thesis Project_

## üìñ Project Overview

This project implements a master's thesis on **modeling optimal software license purchasing in social networks**. The main use case is **Duolingo Super**, which offers individual licenses and group versions for six people (typically twice as expensive as individual licenses).

### üéØ Thesis Objectives

The project aims to:

1. **Prove the equivalence** between the minimum cost license purchasing problem and the **Roman domination problem in graphs**
2. **Analyze different pricing models** (e.g., six-person version 3x more expensive than individual)
3. **Consider the problem of non-simultaneous license purchasing**
4. **Study the dynamic version of the problem**

### üåê Mathematical Model

In the social network model:

- **Vertices** represent users
- **Edges** represent friendship relationships
- **Goal**: Minimize license cost while covering all users

**Available licensing options:**

- **Individual license**: One user, cost S
- **Group license**: Up to 6 connected users, cost G (where G = 2.4S in the basic Duolingo model)

### üî¨ Equivalence with Roman Domination

The license purchasing problem is **mathematically equivalent** to the Roman domination problem in graphs, where:

- Vertices with individual licenses correspond to dominating function value 1
- Vertices that are group license owners correspond to function value 2.4
- Neighbors of group owners are "protected" (value 0)

## ‚ú® Algorithmic Implementation

### üî¨ Exact Algorithms

#### **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**

- Optimal solutions using PuLP
- Implementation of Roman domination constraints
- Optimal for small graphs (up to ~25 vertices)

#### **Naive Algorithm (Brute Force)**

- Exhaustive search of all possibilities
- Verification of correctness for other algorithms
- Useful for very small instances

### üéØ Approximation Algorithms

#### **Greedy Algorithm**

- Heuristic based on vertex degrees
- Fast solutions for large graphs
- Prioritization of high-degree nodes

#### **Dominating Set Algorithm**

- Graph theory-based approximation
- Utilization of classical domination algorithms
- Good solution quality for structural graphs

#### **Randomized Algorithm**

- Random license assignment
- Worst-case scenario analysis

### üß¨ Metaheuristics

#### **Genetic Algorithm**

- Evolutionary optimization with crossover and mutation
- Exploration of solution space
- Adapted to domination problem structure

#### **Simulated Annealing**

- Temperature-based probabilistic search
- Escape from local optima
- Controlled acceptance of worse solutions

#### **Tabu Search**

- Local search with tabu list

- Efficient for medium-sized graphs

### üìä Test Graph Generation

Support for various types of social networks:

- **Random graphs** (Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi) - modeling random connections
