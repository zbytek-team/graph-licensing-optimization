# Graph Licensing Optimization

This repository contains tools and scripts for experimenting with algorithms that optimize licensing costs on graphs.

## Logging

Scripts in the `scripts/` directory allow configuring the logging level. Use the `--log-level` flag to adjust verbosity (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`). The default level is `INFO`.

```
python scripts/run_benchmark.py --log-level DEBUG
```
