## üìù Thesis Overview

This project explores **optimal ways to purchase software licenses in social networks** using **graph domination theory**. The study is motivated by services like **Duolingo Super**, which offer single-user and multi-user licenses. The goal is to minimize licensing costs for a network of friends by modeling the problem as a **Roman domination problem in graphs**.

### üîç Key Objectives

- Model a social network as a **graph**.
- Analyze different licensing options (e.g., single-user vs. group plans).
- Solve the problem using **Roman domination in graphs**.
- Explore alternative pricing structures and dynamic purchasing scenarios.
