"""Expose available algorithm classes.

Some algorithm implementations rely on optional thirdâ€‘party dependencies or are
in an experimental state. Importing them unconditionally would make simply
importing :mod:`src.algorithms` fail if those dependencies are missing.  This
module therefore tries to import each algorithm individually and gracefully
falls back to ``None`` when an import cannot be performed.  The test suite and
consumers that only require a subset of algorithms can still import this module
without pulling in the optional ones.
